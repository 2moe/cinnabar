# Cinnabar

## Preface

Q: Why is it named Cinnabar?  

A:

1. Cinnabar was an ingredient used by ancient Daoist alchemists in their elixirs, much like this project serves as an "ingredient" within CI workflows.  
2. Cinnabar is toxic. This project was developed for *Dirty and Quick* purposes and may produce unexpected side effectsâ€”in a sense, it is not entirely harmless.  
3. Cinnabar, a mineral form of mercury sulfide, is a deep red-colored stone. And ruby is also a deep red stone. Naming a Ruby project "Cinnabar" is particularly fitting.
